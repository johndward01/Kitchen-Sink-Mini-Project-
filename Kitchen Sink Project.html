        <img src="houseguest.jpg" alt="Houseguest Movie" width="500px" height="500px">
        <p>Fast-talking con man Kevin Franklin (Sinbad) is in over his head: He owes $50,000 to the mob, and they want
            to collect. On the run, Franklin happens upon lawyer Gary Young (Phil Hartman) and his family, who are
            waiting for an old friend Young hasn't seen in 25 years. Taking the opportunity for another con -- and to
            save his neck -- Franklin convinces Young he's the old friend and becomes the family's houseguest. He has a
            great hideout from the mob, but the Mafia henchmen are still on his trail.</p>
